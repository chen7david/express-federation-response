# express-federation-response
express-federation-response is a response object created to standardize the response format of micro-services within a federation of services. This module requires a store.json file which is where all messages, directives and project scopes (form-fieds, supported-langs, error-states, etc) are stored. this file can be auto generated by notification-manager.

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```
