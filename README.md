# express-package-response
express-package-response is a response object created to standardize the response format of micro-services within a federation of services. This module requires a store.json file which is where all messages, directives and project scopes (form-fieds, supported-langs, error-states, etc) are stored. this file can be auto generated by notification-manager.
